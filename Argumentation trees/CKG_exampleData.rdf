1. Individuality and Realism:

- Artists like Rembrandt and his contemporaries often depicted black individuals with a high degree of realism, capturing their unique personal characteristics.
- These depictions were based on live models, emphasizing their individuality rather than conforming to stereotypes.

2. Central Figures:

- Black people were not always portrayed as secondary figures or in subservient roles. In many artworks, they were the main subjects, highlighting their importance and presence in society.

3. Diverse Roles:

- Black individuals were shown in various roles beyond servitude, such as musicians, drummers, and participants in biblical scenes.
- These representations showcased their active participation in different aspects of life, reflecting a more inclusive view.

4. Positive Attributes:

- Early depictions often highlighted positive attributes such as dignity, strength, and beauty.
- Artists like Gerrit Dou and Rembrandt portrayed black people with a sense of respect and admiration, avoiding the negative stereotypes that became more common later.

5. Community Presence:

- The presence of a small community of free black people in Amsterdam's Jodenbreestraat influenced these representations.
- This community provided artists with real-life models, allowing for more accurate and respectful depictions.</ns1:hasDescription>

This subject has long remained in the shadows, but wrongly so. Rembrandt and many of his contemporaries made magnificent works of art that depict black people. Those works have been collected in this book. The biggest surprise: the later stereotypes of black people had not yet become dominant. Painters portrayed individual black models from life, with all their personal characteristics. Furthermore, black people were not always secondary figures in minor roles, but sometimes formed the main subject of the art work. This book explores the conditions that gave rise to these remarkable works of art and the reasons the public image of black people changed from about 1660 onwards. It tells the stories of artists who aimed to capture the visual world, the impact of transatlantic slavery, and a small community of free black people in Amsterdam’s Jodenbreestraat.</ns0:P190_has_symbolic_content>
