- These representations showcased their active participation in different aspects of life, reflecting a more inclusive view.

4. Positive Attributes:

- Early depictions often highlighted positive attributes such as dignity, strength, and beauty.
- Artists like Gerrit Dou and Rembrandt portrayed black people with a sense of respect and admiration, avoiding the negative stereotypes that became more common later.
