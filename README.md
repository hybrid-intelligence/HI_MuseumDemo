# HI_MuseumDemo
Repository for the HI project Museum Case demonstrator.

* **Demo_description**: a document I'm writing to try to make sense of how the system works. You can find in the document:

    1. Description of purpose and approach
    2. The scenario description
    3. Some notes on the CKG part I amo not sure about, including additional constraints that I did not yet add to the KG as I don't know if they are needed/can be processed by the Argumentation Framework

    Please feel free to modify and send me feedback or add your own notes for the part that concerns you

* **CKG_DOCUMENTATION**: pretty evidently, the documentation of the Curation Knowledge Graph with some SPARQL as example
* **CKG_exampleData**: the RDF in turtle serialization with the Curation Ontology and the Data about our example scenario
* **CKG_Demo**: Image with the schema of the Ontology
